# Eyeglass

Create a console application that:
	- will receive as parameter a .net assembly file (exe or dll)
	- will display, in the console, as much information as possible: 
		-- all the types (class, interface, enum, delegate, etc…)
		-- their members (fields, properties, constructors, methods, etc…).

For each member, write as many information as you find.
